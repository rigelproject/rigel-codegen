In FreeBSD9, the gettext symbols used in the intl/ and bfd/ subfolders are in libintl and libiconv, which are installed to /usr/local.
In Linux, these symbols are provided by glibc, and we don't need to do anything special to use them.
In lieu of reworking the binutils autotools scripts to handle both cases seamlessly, as has been done in binutils mainline
since we diverged at 2.18, we offer the following additional arguments and environment variables to build.sh:

MAKE=gmake EXTRA_BINUTILS_CONFIGURE_ARGS="--with-libiconv-prefix=/usr/local --with-libintl-prefix=/usr/local" CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib -lintl -liconv" ./build.sh
